              variable buffer was visible in any window, the focus was

      When you need to open the original script file to edit, hit any
      unbound keys of geben-mode and GEBEN asks you to open one. If
      you respond `yes' then GEBEN attempts to visit the file via
      `TRAMP'.
    - More, many things.
