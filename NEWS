  * fixed: With Komodo's Perl Debugging Extension, GEBEN possibly
                caused an internal error when user attempted to set a
                lineno breakpoint at a blank line.

Version 0.23 (2009-02-25)

  * improved: Suppressed unwanted focus changing - when the context
              variable buffer was visible in any window, the focus was
              moved from the debugging buffer to the context variable
              buffer after proceeding any continuous command.

  Redesigned. 

  From this release GEBEN does not require an external DBGp client
  program.

  * changed:
    - GEBEN always mirrors debuggee script files under `geben-mode'.
      When you need to open the original script file to edit, hit any
      unbound keys of geben-mode and GEBEN asks you to open one. If
      you respond `yes' then GEBEN attempts to visit the file via
      `TRAMP'.
    - More, many things.
